## STEPS TO BUILD A MEDICAL INSURANCE MODEL --> WORK FLOW

### INSURANCE COST DATA
    1. Firstly we need to know the type of disease that the person have and through it we need to analyze the cost.
    2. What are the past health condition of a person, Gender, etc.

### DATA ANALYSIS
    1. We have to collect the data and analyze it.
    2. It helps in gaining the meaning of the data has to tell.
    3. We plot the data on the graphs and find the relation between them.

### DATA PRE PROCESSING
    1. As we cannot feed the data directly to out machine learning algorithm so we have to do the pre processing of the data.
    2. After the pre processing the data will be compatible to go in the machine learning model.

### TRAIN TEST SPLIT OF THE DATA
    1. We have to split our data into training data and the testing data.
    2. The machine learning model uses the training data for the training purpose.
    3. The testing data is used for the evaluation of the machine learning model. It helps in checking the performance of our model.

### LINEAR REGRESSION MODEL --> Statistical model (base for other model)
    1. Now we will use our training data and the testing data in our linear regression model.
    2. After training the linear regression model we will check the performance of our model. We will have the trained linear regression model.

### NEW DATA
    1. Once the model is trained we will use the new data to predict the insurance cost.
